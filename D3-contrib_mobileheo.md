Test pass rate : 73%, Coverage rate: 90%

Contributions : I tried to make sure that our code works on the autotest to figure out exactely what the problems we have
                and communicated with my partner and TA to solve them. Whenever I wrote codes or made changes, I made sure
                that my partner understand about them. I helped the tests my partner made to cover more cases. I made local 
                tests for REST.

Went well : Since we didn't have time to write codes for d3 in the first week, we have to reduce redundancy 
            as much as possible. So, we carefully looked through specs and make sure that what we understood 
            is correct by checking posts and posting questions on piazza. Based on what we understood, we drew
            what we need to implement and what will be required for our implementation. We discussed about how 
            to design the specs for D3. This discussion was very helpful to build our functionality with less 
            modification than what we made in D2.
            Also, both of us decided to go to the REST tutorial and that decision maded a lot easier to build
            our REST by having better understanding of what REST is and it is actually doing.

Went bad : We did not have time to do D3 on the first weeks because of other projects and presentations.
           I think we made enough local test, but were not able to catch all the bugs in time.
