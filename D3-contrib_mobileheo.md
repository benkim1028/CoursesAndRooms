Test pass rate : 73%, Coverage rate: 90%

Contributions : I tried to make sure that our code works on the autotest to figure out exactely what the problems we have
                and communicated with my partner and TA to solve them. Whenever I wrote codes or made changes, I made sure
                that my partner understand about them. I helped the tests my partner made to cover more cases. I made local 
                tests for REST.
