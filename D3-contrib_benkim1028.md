Test pass rate : 73%, Coverage rate: 90%

Contributions : I implemented Group and Apply. We worked together to debug.

what went well: We talked about our plan first and then started to implement so it took less time to finish this project.
                (but we failed to catch errors that we had, so we got only 73% of pass rate)

what didn't go well: We were so busy studying the other stuff so we could not dedicate much time for this project on the first week.
                     We could finish the project on time but we did not have enough time to catch all the bugs.
