Test pass rate : 17%, Coverage rate: 13%
Due to exit 125, I was not able to get the final pass rate and coverage rate.
Contributions : I wrote codes that calls a zip file and access to the files that the zip file contains in InsightFacade
                as well as in the test. This helps to implement addDataset function and debug it. I used Promise.all to
                create a data set that does not have invalid data. I made many helper functions that need to implement
                performQuery and try to make sure that this return expected outputs. Function removeDataset was not
                difficult to implement, it took couple hours to finish that function.
